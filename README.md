# DE2024_assignment2
Repository for the second assignment of the data engineering course at JADS. The project is focused around understanding energy consumption and related trendsfor policy makers.

This repository implements an Energy Dashboard to provide policymakers with insights into electricity consumption and power grid performance. Combining batch and stream processing into a single pipeline, deployed on a virtual machine, the dashboard supports sustainability and grid resilience goals.

### Features
Trend Analysis: Aggregates historical electricity data to uncover long-term trends.  
Regional Comparisons: Compares annual electricity usage across Dutch regions.  
Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks (simulated) national power outages for quick responses.

### Objective
By merging historical data with real-time insights, this dashboard equips policymakers with tools to:  
Shape sustainable energy policies.  
Address regional energy needs.  
Enhance grid reliability and efficiency.
